This repository contains code and models.

#### Data Preprocessing

You can run the [`GPT_generate.py`](https://github.com/YuxiXie/SG-Deep-Question-Generation/blob/master/scripts/train_classifier.sh) to generate the train set and test set for CKS. 

#### Models

We release our proposed models in this work, including the CKS and Event Detect system. The CKS is used to select the best commonsense knowledge for each word. The EDBase is utilized to identify the trigger word.


## Training

* run [`scripts/run.sh`](https://github.com/YuxiXie/SG-Deep-Question-Generation/blob/master/scripts/train_classifier.sh) to train the ***CKS*** 

* run [`scripts/run.sh`](https://github.com/YuxiXie/SG-Deep-Question-Generation/blob/master/scripts/train_generator.sh) to train on the ***Event Detection*** task.
